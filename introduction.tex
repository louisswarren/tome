The Agda code below has been written in \emph{literate Agda}, which allows Agda
to be mixed with \LaTeX. The files which have been used to typeset this document
can also be evaluated and type checked by Agda. Some trivial proofs are omitted
from the typeset document; these are only hidden for brevity, and are still
present in the code and used by Agda. The results on which they rely are
therefore still verified. This should not be mistaken for use of postulates,
wherein Agda itself is told to assume that a proof exists. Postulates are used
only in the module for outputting natural deduction proofs as \LaTeX for use
with the \emph{bussproofs} package. All other code type checks with Agda in safe
mode, meaning that it provably halts.

Each of the following sections corresponds to its own literate Agda file.
Sections named with a file name ending in `.lagda' are modules. Each section
imports the modules above it, unless stated otherwise. These module declarations
and imports have been hidden for brevity.
